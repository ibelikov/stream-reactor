# Kafka Connect BigQuery Connector

This is an implementation of a sink connector from [Apache Kafka] to [Google BigQuery], built on top
of [Apache Kafka Connect].

## History

This connector was [originally developed by WePay](https://github.com/wepay/kafka-connect-bigquery).
In late 2020 the project moved to [Confluent](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-bigquery),
with both companies taking on maintenance duties. 

In March 2025, Lenses.io forked the project to maintain it and provide support for the community and customers.
